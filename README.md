## Tech Stack
- Frontend : React JS
- Backend : Node Js 
- Database : MySql

## Note
- I have created backend and frontend for user flows only.
- Code for admin ( who will manage users and upload exam series is currently pending )
- So currently, you need to add data to database manually .
- you can find backend at : [examwala backend](https://github.com/grvbng7/examwala_backend)
